# DSC180Capstone - Assignment 2 (Paper Reimplementation)

## Overview
Assignment 2 was reimplementing the paper  *DE-HNN: An effective neural model for Circuit Netlist representation*, which essentially proposed Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neu-
ral Networks (DE-HNNs) as an improved way to model directed hypergraphs, such as those
often used in representations of chip design data. More specifically, DE-HNNs address the
challenges of data size and capturing long range interactions between nodes through virtual
nodes. The assignment didnâ€™t involve fully implementing the entire process - but instead
mostly focused on replicating the representation and predictive results
