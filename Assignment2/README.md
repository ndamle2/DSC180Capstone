# DSC180Capstone - Assignment 2 (Paper Reimplementation)

## Overview
Assignment 2 was reimplementing the paper  *DE-HNN: An effective neural model for Circuit Netlist representation*, which essentially proposed Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neu-
ral Networks (DE-HNNs) as an improved way to model directed hypergraphs, such as those
often used in representations of chip design data. More specifically, DE-HNNs address the
challenges of data size and capturing long range interactions between nodes through virtual
nodes. The assignment didnâ€™t involve fully implementing the entire process - but instead
mostly focused on replicating the representation and predictive results.

## Setup
### Data
The data for this assignment can be pulled with the github repository and is located in the superblue18 folder.

## Creating environment
- Requirements.txt contains all packages required to run the notebook
- `conda create --name assignment2 --file requirements.txt` will create the necessary conda environment
- Depending on the machine with which you plan on running this code, you may be able to configure your torch install to include CUDA and GPU usability. This code is set up Torch with CPUs, however, and may require adjustment if changes are made.
- Users may also need to install optional torch-geometric dependencies, such as torch-scatter, torch-sparse, and torch-cluster.
- These can be installed with: `pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster`

## Running Code  
- The jupyter notebook can be run sequentially, with relevant output displayed below cells as needed.
- To use the conda environment in jupyter notebook, you may need to configure jupyter using ipykernel:
  ```
  conda activate assignment1
  conda install ipykernel
  ipython kernel install --user --name=assignment1
  ```
