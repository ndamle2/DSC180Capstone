Digital Integrated Circuit Graph Data
FreePDK15/NanGate15 Introductory Distribution 
2023-07-25  by Abhinav Sinha and W. Rhett Davis, NC State University

These files were generated with physical design of 
example designs using the 15nm FreePDK predictive process
design kit and the Si2/Silvaco/NanGate 15nm Open Cell Library.

The database-units-to-user-units (DBUtoUU) conversion factor
for this dataset is 2000.  Integer dimensions should be 
divided by this factor to get real dimensions in microns.

In addition to the contents described in the PDF documentation,
this distribution contains the following additional files:

  [design]_route_opt.def       – Original design data
  [design]_congestion.rpt      – Routing congestion report
  [design]-congestion.png      – Screen-shot of layout and congestion
  route_opt.check_routes       – Routing violations and resources per layer
  route_opt.report_utilization – Ratio of required area to available area
  route_opt.report_clock_qor.structure – Detailed clock-tree information
  route_opt.report_qor         – Summary of system timing and other details

Note that the original LEF files used to create cells.json.gz
are also provided in the lef directory.

Note finally that the units for both CLK_PER and CLK_UNCERTAINTY in 
settings.csv is picoseconds.  This will be confusing to some,
because many variants of the design xbar have a clock-period
constraint equal to or smaller than the clock uncertainty, 
which produces unusual results.  This is reflected in the 
provided route_opt.report_qor files, which show a large number
of timing violations.  As such, the impact of the CLK_PER
feature is largely random.  However, the impact of the 
CORE_UTILIZATION and MAX_ROUTING_LAYER features is still 
quite useful.
