# DSC 180 Quarter 1 Projects
This Quarter 1 was split into 2 assignments. Assignment 1 was an analysis of New York Subway data, which served as an introduction to graph analysis and representation. The code and set-up instructions for that assignment can be found in the readme of the Assignment 1 folder.  

Assignment 2 was a reimplementation of a paper that proposed Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Networks (DE-HNNs) as an improved way to model directed hypergraphs, such as those often used in representations of chip design data. Given the scope and complexity of the paper, assignment 2 focused on reimplementing the paper's representation of the graph data. The code and set-up instructions can be found in the Assignment 2 folder.
